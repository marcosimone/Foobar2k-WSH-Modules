# Foobar2k-WSH-Modules
This is a collection of modules that I have written for foobar2000 (arguably the best media player on windows).  In order to use these modules, you need to have the [WSH Panel Mod](https://code.google.com/archive/p/foo-wsh-panel-mod/downloads), you just have to download the component and drop it in the component list in preferences.  You should also have [Component UI](http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_ui_columns).  There are plenty of tutorials on how to set these things up.
## Modules made so far:
* Themed Volume Slider
* Themed Seekbar


### Themed Volume Slider
This is an ordinary volume slider, has all the same functionality as the built in volume slider.  However, this one takes on the theme set in your preferences, and has adjustable settings like slider width and margin sizes.  It is a volume slider, so it does all the normal volume slider things.

### Themed Seekbar
Same deal as the volume slider, takes on your theme colors set in preferences and has all the capability of the original.  There are plans to make it more customizable via the properties.
